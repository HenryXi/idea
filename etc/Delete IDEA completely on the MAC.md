# Delete IDEA completely on the MAC
In addition to deleting IDEA in your application, you also need to delete a few directories
```
/Users/<user_name>/Library/Application Support/IntelliJIdeaXXXXXX(installed plugins)
/Users/<user_name/Library/Caches/IntelliJIdeaXXXXXX(cache,log,localhistory)
/Users/<user_name/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdeaXXXXXX(config for your IDEA)
/Users/<user_name/Library/ApplicationSupport/JetBrains/IntelliJIdeaXXXXXX(other config)
```
